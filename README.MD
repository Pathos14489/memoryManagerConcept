# txtai powered Long Term Memory(LTM) Manager for Chatbots(or other stuff)
hey I suck at writing these.

# server.py

Toss the `server.py` file in the txtai repo(https://github.com/neuml/txtai) directory after cloning it and making sure it works. Don't ask, I forget how I got it set up tbh.

# Running Tests

```
npm install
```
Then to verify everything works run this:
```
node test.js
```
